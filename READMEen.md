# Xiaozhi ESP32 Server Configuration Editor

@config_editor.py Thanks to [github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server) developers for open-sourcing the project that allows us to experience the local Xiaozhi service system.

## Project Introduction

Through an intuitive interface, users can easily view and modify various configurations in the `data/.config.yaml` file without manually editing the YAML file.

## Development Information

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI library)
- ruamel.yaml (YAML processing library)

### Dependencies
If you want to run the source code or build the program yourself, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
# requirements.txt
ruamel.yaml==0.17.21
PyYAML==6.0
pyinstaller==5.9.0  # only needed for building executable
```

Main dependency descriptions:
- **ruamel.yaml**: For processing YAML files, preserving comments and formatting
- **PyYAML**: For simple YAML processing
- **tkinter**: Python standard library for creating GUI interfaces (no separate installation required)

### Building Yourself
To build the executable:
1. Install the required dependencies
2. Use PyInstaller to build the executable:
   ```
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed config_editor.py
   ```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why did the format of the configuration file change after saving?**
